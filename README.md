### Structure
Main directory is called problems. It contains subdirectories
that are named the same as names of problems in leetcode.
Inside each subdirectories there is a minimum three files.
One for solution, one for test and one for explaining and links.

Example of structure:
problems
    remove-duplicates
        solution.txt
        remove-duplicates.spec.ts
        remove-duplicates.ts
