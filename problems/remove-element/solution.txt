Two pointers solution. One goes up from the start of the array, the second goes down from
the end. When the first pointer meets number we need to delete it stops. After that the
second pointer search value that not equal the number. As soon as it is found, number from
the first pointer and the second pointer are swap. If second pointer doesn't find number that
not equal the number we need to delete and reach the first pointer - then algorithm
stops and returns current 'k' value.
